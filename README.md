# Fizz-Buzz

Simple FizzBuzz program that prints out numbers from 1 to 100. When a number is a multiple of 3, instead of printing the number, the program prints "Fizz". If the number is a multiple of 5, instead of printing the number, the program prints "Buzz". If a number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, the program prints "FizzBuzz".
